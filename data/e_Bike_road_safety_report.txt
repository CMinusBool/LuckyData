E-bike Safety Perception Report
Executive Summary
This report examines safety perceptions among e-bike cyclists based on a comprehensive survey study conducted in Taiwan with 220 participants. The research investigated psychological factors influencing e-bike road safety, including mental workload, user experience, and risk perception.
Key Findings
Mental Workload and Speed Relationship

E-bike riders generally perceived the riding task as relatively easy (DALI score: 29.32/100)
Mental workload increased significantly with riding speed
High-speed cyclists (>25 km/h) experienced greater visual demands, attention requirements, and time pressure
Male cyclists perceived higher temporal demands than female cyclists

Risk Perception Patterns

Low Anxiety, High Arousal: Average anxiety score was 2.3/10, while arousal was 8.2/10
Cyclists with crash experience reported significantly higher anxiety levels than those without
High-speed riders experienced more anxiety than medium-speed riders
Strong positive correlation between mental workload (DALI) and anxiety levels

Critical Safety Factors
1. Speed as Primary Risk Factor

High-speed riders (>25 km/h): 72.7% crash rate
Medium-speed riders (15-25 km/h): 18.2% crash rate
Low-speed riders (<15 km/h): 9.1% crash rate
Modified e-bikes showed 20 times higher crash rates than regulation-compliant bikes

2. User Experience Quality

Pragmatic quality (utility and usability satisfaction) was the strongest predictor of crashes
Cyclists with crash experience had lower satisfaction with bike functionality
Product quality emerged as the most important factor for traffic safety

Gender Differences

Male cyclists: Tend to ride at higher speeds, perceive greater time pressure
Female cyclists: Show higher satisfaction with bike attractiveness, prefer lower speeds
Males represented 67.6% of high-speed riders vs. 32.4% females

Safety Recommendations
For Cyclists

Self-monitoring systems: Mobile apps to report mental workload and anxiety before riding
Speed awareness: Maintain speeds below 25 km/h for optimal safety
Regular maintenance: Ensure proper bike functionality to improve pragmatic quality

For Manufacturers

Design focus: Prioritize utility and usability in product development
Quality assurance: Strengthen product designs to meet functional needs
Technology integration: Develop smartphone applications for cyclist feedback and improvement

for Policymakers

Infrastructure: Create separate lanes for e-bikes to reduce mixed traffic exposure
Education: Implement tailored safety training based on individual risk profiles
Enforcement: Strict prohibition of e-bike modifications that exceed legal speed limits
Speed management: Consider dynamic speed limits based on traffic conditions

Risk Profile Identification
High-Risk Groups

Cyclists habitually riding above 25 km/h
Users of modified e-bikes
Riders with low satisfaction regarding bike functionality
Male cyclists in high-speed categories

Protective Factors

High pragmatic quality satisfaction
Consistent riding below 25 km/h speed limit
Regular bike maintenance and quality checks
Self-awareness of mental workload and anxiety levels

Conclusion
The study reveals that e-bike safety perception is primarily influenced by speed behavior and product quality satisfaction. While riders generally find e-biking manageable, those who speed or have poor product experiences face significantly higher crash risks. A multi-faceted approach involving technology, education, and policy intervention is essential for improving e-bike road safety.
